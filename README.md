# Inverted Pendulum Simulation

Simulation of an inverted pendulum on a cart stabilized with a PID controller. Input is the angle of the pendulum and output is the rotation of the wheels.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in the browser. Try *gently* tugging on the pendulum's mass or the cart and watch the system stabilize itself.
